# Introduction 
this project was designed for stabilizing security in the desired vicinity , as it uses computer vision technologies and deep learning to detect listed emergencies like fire , car accidents and violence.  
- built a violence  detection model from a video using the architecture og VGG16 - LSTm model.  
- built a fire detection model using imageai library for customized object detection. 
- Integrated a pre-trained accident detection model into the project.   
- Used multiprocessing library in order to run all the models simultaneously
